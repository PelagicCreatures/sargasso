### Simple, Fast, Supervised Javascript Controllers for HTML Elements.

[Demo Site](https://blog.myanti.social)

HTML elements sometimes need a nervous system to see and respond to what's going on around them - Sargasso element controllers are fully aware of their environment.

Events such as Document (DOM) insertions and deletions, HIJAX Page load, Scrolling, Resizing, Orientation and messages from fully Managed Web Workers are passed to Sargasso controllers allowing them to efficiently implement any behavior they need to perform.

This is a very lightweight, pure ES6 framework (with only few dependencies) which aims to use the most advanced stable features of modern browsers to maximum effect leaving the historical cruft, kludges and code barnacles infesting older web frameworks behind. The result is lean, highly performant and clean code that simplifies the complex technologies behind modern progressive web apps and web sites.

HIJAX made easy - this framework implements an asynchronous page loading scheme which supports deep linking and lightning fast page loads where only dynamic content areas are merged between pages leaving css, js, web workers and wrapper elements intact. Sargasso controller instances are managed as needed when their element appears in the DOM and destroyed when their element is removed.

Performance is optimized using shared event listening services which are fully debounced during large updates. Services are provided to schedule content changes using the browser's animation frame event loop and computation heavy tasks can be easily offloaded to managed web workers resulting in highly performant pages.


```npm install @pelagiccreatures/sargasso```

Bootstrap Sargasso:
-------------------
The ES and the CommonJS bundles both expose:

* sargasso.Sargasso - the sargasso super class
* sargasso.registerSargassoClass - function to register your sub classes
* sargasso.bootSargasso - start sargasso services and HIHAX

[Most browsers](https://caniuse.com/#search=modules) are aware of ES6 and modules these days but but you can use the module/nomodule scheme to fall back to the common js bundle if needed.
```
<script type="module">
	import sargasso from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@pelagiccreatures/sargasso/dist/sargasso.es.js"
	... your code here ...
</script>

// optional - deal with the antiques if yo see fit.
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@pelagiccreatures/sargasso/dist/sargasso.common.js" nomodule></script>
<script nomodule defer>
	... your code here ...
</script>
```
In production you probably want to host the bundles yourself instead of using the CDN and probably even make your own bundles including your subclasses using webpack or rollup or something.

For the '... your code here ...' part, it's the same in both cases. You need to at least start up the services.

```
<script>

	let options = {
		hijax: {
			onError: (level, message) => { alert('Something went wrong. ' + message) }
		}
	}

	// boot supervisors and HIJAX loader
	window.loadPageHandler = sargasso.bootSargasso(options)

	// define a custom class and register the classname.
	class MyClass extends sargasso.Sargasso {} // This won't do very much...
	sargasso.registerSargassoClass('MyClass',MyClass)

</script>
```

### Adding Your Sargasso class to an HTML element

Sargasso watches the DOM for any elements tagged with the `data-sargasso-class` attribute and instantiates the Sargasso class specified while hooking up the appropriate services. When the underlying element is removed from the DOM (loading a new page or something) it automatically destroys any dangling Sargasso objects.

```
<div data-sargasso-class="MyClass">This element has a MyClass Sargasso controller</div>
```

You can also defer the instantiation using the lazy method by tagging it with `data-lazy-sargasso-class` instead of `data-sargasso-class` which will only start up the class when the element is visible in the viewport

### HIJAX
Sargasso automatically captures `<a href="..">` tags and calls the LoadPageHandler instead of letting the browser load pages. You can make a link be ignored by hijax by setting the '<a href=".." data-no-hijax>'. Offsite links and links with targets are automatically ignored. bootSargasso also returns the function `LoadPageHandler(href)`. You must call this to load a new page programatically.

EG. instead of `location.href= '/home'`, use `LoadPageHandler('/home')`

## Mark dynamic content

New pages are loaded via AJAX and are merged with the current page only replacing elements marked with `data-hijax` from the new page.
```
<html>
	<head>
	</head>
	<body>
		static stuff

		<div id="page-body" data-hijax>
			<p>this changes from page to page</p>
			<div>lots of html here</div>
		</div>

		more static stuff

		<div id="some-element" data-hijax>
			<p>this also changes from page to page</p>
		</div>

		more static stuff
	</body>
<html>

```
Note that data-hijax elements must have well formed child html elements. Not like this:
```<div>I'm just text. No child elements. Won't work.</div>```

### Defining SubClasses:

Your Sargasso subclasses can subscribe to event feeds to be notified of events.

The instance is associated with an element `this.element`

```
class MyClass extends Sargasso {
	constructor(element, options) {
		// subscribe to events
		super(element, {
			watchDOM: [true:false],
			watchScroll: [true:false],
			watchResize: [true:false],
			watchOrientation: [true:false],
			watchViewport: [true:false]
		})
	}

	// Methods that will be called when various events occur. Do only what you need to do.

	DOMChanged() {}      // called if 'watchDOM: true' when DOM changes
	didScroll() {}       // called if 'watchScroll: true' when scroll occurs
	didResize() {}       // called if 'watchResize: true' when resize changes
	enterViewport() {}   // called if 'watchViewport: true' when element is entering viewport
	exitViewport() {}    // called if 'watchViewport: true' when element is exiting viewport
	enterFullscreen() {} // called if 'watchOrientation: true' when user rotates phone or if setFullscreen is called
	exitFullscreen() {}  // called on exit fullscreen
	newPage(old,new)     // on a new page
	didBreakpoint()      // new screen width breakpoint
	elementEvent(e)      // this.element received an 'sargasso' event
}

registerSargassoClass('MyClass', MyClass)

```

### Sargasso Object Lifecycle

When the object is created the supervisor will call the `start()`` method of the object. You should use this hook to set up any element events you need to respond to such as clicking a button or key presses. Beyond responding to scrolling, resize and other responsive events, you will probably want to interact with your element in some way.

Properties
* this.element - the element we are controlling

Utility Methods:
* this.hasClass('cssclass') 		// returns true if this.element has cssclass
* this.addClass('cssclass') 		// add cssclass to this.element
* this.removeClass('cssclass')	// remove cssclass to this.element
* this.queueFrame(function)			// queue a function to execute that changes the DOM

Example Button Handler:

```
class MyButtonClass extends Sargasso {

	// listen for click
	start() {
		super.start()

		this.clicker = (e) => {
			this.clicked()
		}
		this.element.addEventListener('click', this.clicker, false)
	}

	// cleanup listener
	sleep() {
		this.element.removeEventListener('click', this.clicker)
		super.sleep()
	}

	// use an animation frame to mutate the DOM
	clicked() {
		let frame = () {
			this.addClass('clicked')
		}
		this.queueFrame(frame)
	}
}

Then in HTML:

<style>
	.clicked { background-color:red; }
</style>

<button data-sargasso-class="MyButtonClass">Click me and I'll turn red!</button>
```

### Using Animation Frames

Don't do any long processes in the responsive callbacks or things might bog down the browser UI. To avoid any chaotic repaints you should only make DOM changes inside animation frames - see a lazy loading example below. You should offload any heavy weight processing to a web worker.

```
class MyClass extends Sargasso {
	constructor(element,options = {}) {
		options.watchViewport = true
		super(element,options)
	}

	enterViewport() {
		// do some stuff such as modify element html or classes
		let frame = () => {
			this.element.innerHTML = '<p>Hello viewport!'
		}
		this.queueFrame(frame)
	}
}

registerSargassoClass('MyClass', MyClass)

```

### Using managed Web Workers

Offload compute heavy tasks to a new thread and listen for result

Pass in a url of a web worker js file or create an inline web worker
from string of raw code.

The worker code does the work when it receives an onmessage event

e.data contains the params for our worker

This web worker, once installed, could be used by many instances so sargasso sets e.data.uid to the id on the instance that is invoking the worker which we need to pass back in the postMessage so we know who is who.

```
class MySubClass extends Sargasso {

	...

	someMethod() {

		/*
			myWorker can be inline code or the url of a worker script to download
		*/

		let myWorker = `onmessage = function (e) {
			const baseNumber = e.data.power
			let result = 0
			for (var i = Math.pow(baseNumber, 7); i >= 0; i--) {
				result += Math.atan(i) * Math.tan(i)
			};
			postMessage({ uid: e.data.uid, result: 'Done doing pointless math: ' + result })
		}`

		// create the worker to be managed by sargasso and give it an id
		this.workerStart('myworkId', myWorker)


		let data = { power: 12 }
		this.workerPostMessage('myworkId', data) // send message to the worker
	}

	// listen for worker result
	workerOnMessage (id, e) {
		if (id === 'myworkId') {
			const frame = () => {
				this.element.innerHTML = e.data
			}
			this.queueFrame(frame)
		}
		super.workerOnMessage(id, e)
	}
}
```


### Viewing the Test Page in the example directory
To use Hijax you have to serve the files (window.popstate can't deal with file://) so run SimpleHTTPServer in the project example directory to see demo page
```
python -m localhost.py
```

then point your browser to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`
